Istvan implemented the observer pattern

For the Builder Pattern I first created a class that contained variables and components each object would have, then a Builder class with methods that resulted in a completed, built game object. The fish director assigned certain values to variables and components, and the fish spawner takes all that and fully creates the fish in the scene.

The Object Pool uses queues and prefabs to create as many bullets as the player can shoot, but will never go over that amount.
